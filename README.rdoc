This was a project that Leif Steffenson, West Kraemer, and I created for our Trio Project at Wyncode. We were given 4 days to come up with a small site concept and use the Rails framework to create it. We then had to pitch the idea in front of a group of 50+ people. 

We created Trip_Checkr as a way for someone to store their past vaction destinations and some basic info about them. The idea was that people's memories fade over time and a quick reminder of their own past vacations, thoughts, and reviews might be able to help them make their future vacation decisions. 

We used Bootstrap and Rails to complete the site.
